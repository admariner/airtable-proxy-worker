> A [Cloudflare Worker](http://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that allows you to make secure requests to the [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/api) from your frontend.

## Features

- Keep your Airtable Base ID and API Key secret while still allowing frontend apps to access data from Airtable's API.
- Limit requests to specific methods and tables. For example, using this library, you can make sure that public users can only make `GET` requests to your tables.
- Automatically build and push updates to your Cloudflare Worker using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/). 


## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with [Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/) enabled.
- An [Airtable Base ID](https://community.airtable.com/t/what-is-the-app-id-where-do-i-find-it/2984) and your [Airtable API key](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key-).
- Node and Node Package Manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)).
- Familiarity with your computer's terminal/command line interface.

### Building Locally

The easiest way to see this project in action is to build your Worker locally and copy/paste it into Cloudflare's UI:

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/portable-cto/airtable-proxy-worker.git`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build the worker with your Airtable App/Base ID and API Key: `AIRTABLE_API_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXX AIRTABLE_API_KEY=keyXXXXXXXXXX npm run build`
- Upload the built `dist/worker.js` file to [cloudflareworkers.com](https://cloudflareworkers.com/) to test your script.

Your Airtable's tables will be available via the table name. For example, if my Airtable base has a table name `posts`, it would be available at `https://tutorial.cloudflareworkers.com/posts`.

In order to deploy the worker to your own personal worker, upload it via the web UI and click "Deploy".

### Routing

By default, the routes for each of your tables are available at `YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN/RESOURCE_NAME`. For example, if my custom domain is `http://api.example.com` and the table I want to access is called `users`, I would access the API at `http://api.example.com/users`.

You can change this routing using a `PROXY_PREFIX` as described in the **Configuration** section below.

### Automated Deployment

You can also use Travis to automatically deploy updates to your Worker. Just add the following environment variables to your Travis settings:

- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_KEY`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`
- `AIRTABLE_API_BASE_ID`
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`

The `deploy` block in the `.travis.yml` file will automatically update your worker in Cloudflare when the `master` branch is built using the script at `scripts/deploy`.

### Configuration

In addition to the required `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_API_BASE_ID` variables, you can also set the following configuration options as ENV vars:

- `AIRTABLE_API_URL` - Defaults to `https://api.airtable.com`.
- `AIRTABLE_API_VERSION` - Defaults to `v0`.
- `PROXY_PREFIX` - Use this if your Cloudflare worker's routes are prefixed by something before the Airtable resource name. For example, you may want to call `mycustomdomain.com/api/posts` instead of `mycustomdomain.com/posts`. In this example, you would add `api` as a prefix.
- `ALLOWED_TARGETS` - Use this to lock down your Airtable API to specific resources and methods. For example, a stringified JSON object like this: `'[{"resource":"posts","method":"GET,PUT"},{"resource":"comments","method":"*"}]'` will allow `GET` and `PUT` requests on the `posts` resource and all request methods on the `comments` resource. Allows all methods for all resources by default.
- `PROXY_CACHE_TIME` - Defaults to `0`. The number of seconds set on the `Cache-Control` header to use Cloudflare's caching.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the [issues on Github](https://github.com/portable-cto/airtable-proxy-worker/issues).

### Testing

Before you make a pull request, please add or update any relevant tests. You can run the test suite (uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)): `npm run test:local`

Also run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure that code styling is consistent: `npm run prettier`.

### Pull Request Process

1. Make sure tests are running and linting passes before you submit a PR.
2. Update any relevant parts of the documentation in the `readme.md` file.
3. Update the `changelog.md` file with any new updates, breaking changes, or important notes.
3. Run the build process to make sure it passes too: `npm run build`.
4. Include a link to any relevant issues in the PR on Github. If there are problems with your PR, we will discuss them in Github before merging.

### Releases

This library uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to inform users of breaking and non-breaking changes. When a new release is ready, the following steps will be taken:

- Make sure tests still pass: `npm test`.
- Run the release script: `npm version <SEMANTIC_VERSION> && git push --tags` with the release number you want to use.

This will create a new Tag in Github.
